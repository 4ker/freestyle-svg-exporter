freestyle-svg-exporter
======================

a Blender addon for exporting stylized lines created by the Freestyle render engine to an SVG format. 

To use (for now):
- find parameter_editor.py (at ../blender/release/scripts/freestyle/modules/ or ../blender/2.7x/scrips/freestyle/modules/) and replace it with the version in this repository/patch
- register addon.py as an addon via User Preferences > Addons > install from file

The GUI for the exporter should now be visible in the render tab of the properties window.


If you experience any problems with this exporter, please let me know!
