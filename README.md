freestyle-svg-exporter
======================

A Blender addon for exporting stylized lines created by the Freestyle render engine to an SVG format. 
This is the development version: More features, more bugs!

To use (for now):
- overwrite the current addon file with the one in this repository. 

- enable the addon via User Preferences > Addons > SVG

The GUI for the exporter should now be visible in the render tab of the properties window.


If you experience any problems with this exporter, please let me know!
